# NN-from-scratch
Building some neural networks from "scratch" for learning purposes

## Plan

### Building from scratch:

- logistic feedforward NN
- backpropagation
- stochastic gradient descent 
- batch normalization 
- ( maybe dropout regularization)

### In TensorFlow:

#### Network architectures:

- recurrent NN
- convolutional NN
- neural ODE


#### Components to implement:  

- RMSProp with momentum
- Adam 

#### Regularization: 

- dropout 
- batch normalization
- L1, L2
