# NN-from-scratch
Building some neural networks from scratch for learning purposes

## Plan

### Network architectures to build: 

- feedforward NN
- recurrent NN
- neural ODE


### Components to implement

- feedforward calculation
- backpropagation 
- (stochastic) gradient descent 
- dropout regularization
